# hey-9
*the four-legged social network*

App live on Heroku:[hey-9.herokuapp.com](https://hey-9.herokuapp.com/)

Hey-9 exists to elevate the social situation of our beloved canine counterparts.

How?  

By crafting a uniquely local community that simulates a proper pack for your animals.
Going for a walk? Invite one of your dog's friends to go with.  Visiting a dog park 
tomorrow?  Set up an event, and let your neighborhood know there's fun to be had.  

(We've also added a search feature allowing our users to locate new dogs they might not
yet know and 'friend' them!)

There are many hindrances to going for a walk, and a large one is the weather.  Hey-9
tells you the current weather, we're you're at, in real time, as well as what the conditions
will be like in an hour from now.  Never again(ideally), will you get unknowingly caught in
a rain storm, and you can plan ahead if one is close.  If a truly disastrous event is inbound,
you'll be alerted so you can help keep your pets calm.  

Hey-9 is about dogs, but dogs have other needs besides community - aside from viewing the dogs
in your neighborhood (which you can do!), local information on dog parks, as well as pet stores, is 
gathered and presented all in one place.  

Social media is one of today's greatest social norms, but we believe the trend should extend beyond 
the species 'fence'.  Hey-9 aims to encourage proper dog ownership by providing your dogs the 
relationships and support they deserve.
